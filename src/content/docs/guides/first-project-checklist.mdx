## When Your Chappals Arrive
### Breaking In Your New Pair
<Steps>
1. Wear your new chappals for short periods initially to allow the leather to mold to your feet

2. Use a leather conditioner if the straps feel stiff - this helps soften them faster

3. Store properly when not wearing - use shoe trees or stuff with newspaper to maintain shape
</Steps>
