## How to Choose Your Size

<Steps>

1. Measure Your Feet
   Stand on a piece of paper and trace around your foot. Measure the length from heel to longest toe. Compare with our size chart.

2. Consider Width
   Peshawari Chappals come in standard widths. If you have wide feet, consider ordering half a size up for comfort.

3. Break-In Period
   Genuine leather molds to your foot shape. New chappals may feel snug initially but will stretch and become more comfortable over time.

</Steps>


## Caring for Your Chappals

<Aside type="tip">
  Never expose leather chappals to water or direct sunlight. Store in a cool, dry place and use shoe trees to maintain shape.
</Aside>

Regular maintenance keeps your Peshawari Chappals looking beautiful for years. Clean with a soft cloth after each wear, condition the leather monthly, and polish for special occasions.
