  - "The Peshawari Chappal is a versatile footwear option that can be dressed up or down. While traditionally worn with Shalwar Kameez, it also looks great with jeans and a kurta."
  - "For a formal look, opt for a classic black or brown chappal with a polished finish. Pair it with a crisp Shalwar Kameez and a waistcoat for a sophisticated ensemble."
  - "For a more casual vibe, try a tan or mustard chappal with jeans and a t-shirt. The key is to experiment and find a style that suits your personality."
